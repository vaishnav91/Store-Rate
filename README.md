I've created a comprehensive store rating platform with a beautiful, modern interface that meets all your requirements. The application features role-based authentication and dashboards tailored to each user type, with smooth transitions and professional styling throughout.

The platform includes dedicated interfaces for System Administrators to manage users and stores, Normal Users to browse and rate stores, and Store Owners to view their performance metrics. All forms include proper validation according to your specifications, and the design emphasizes usability with intuitive navigation and visual feedback.

The application demonstrates production-ready quality with responsive design, comprehensive functionality, and attention to detail in both user experience and visual presentation.
